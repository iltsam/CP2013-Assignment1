# CP2013-Assignment1
The following are acceptable projects for this subject at the Townsville campus. Other projects
may also be acceptable at different JCU campuses. Contact your local instructor to discuss your
options. When selecting a different project, please keep in mind that:
1. The project must be a software development project, i.e. it requires writing source code of
some sort rather than just customisation of a software system (NOTE: CMS-content
management systems are allowed);
2. The project could be implemented using two different computer languages or development
environments. This is extremely important in this subject. The students must experience
first-hand that some parts of their project will be environment independent while the other
parts may be quite affected by the chosen environments.
3. The project must have some sort of persistent data storage, e.g. relational database such
as mySQL.
4. The project must have a modern user-interface, e.g. interactive web-site.

Projects are from the textbook:
1. Section-III The payroll Case Study
Note that each team may select different set of user stories for each of the above projects. Your
instructor plays the role of a client/customer. You need to discuss your proposed solution with your
instructor during the workshops. This cp2013 subject prepares you for the cp3046/3047 project
subjects, where you will implement a software system for a real client.
To obtain the full marks during the marking sessions, you need to demonstrate two systems which
are functionally as similar as possible but are developed using two different languages. The two
language rule is only relevant for the programming assessment items. Please check with your
instructor if it is not clear. This subject encourages as much student-client communication as
possible during the workshops.
Resources. The assignment must be done using two different development environments or
languages per group/team, for example (and not limited to):
 HTML, Python, C#, C++, C, Flash, PHP, Java (J2SE), Java servlets (J2EE)
 Javascript+Html5
 Native iOS app (iPhone, iPad) Objective-C
 Android App
 CMS-content management system (e.g. Wordpress, Joomla)
